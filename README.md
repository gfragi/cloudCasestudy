# Cloud Services Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains a suite of tools and notebooks for analyzing cloud service usage, performing clustering, and calculating resources. It utilizes data science and machine learning techniques to optimize resource allocation and predict usage patterns for cloud service users.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x
- Pip package manager

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the necessary Python packages:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/gfragi/cloudCasestudy.git
cd cloudCasestudy
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
The project includes Jupyter notebooks that can be used to run different analyses:

* clustering-storage.ipynb for clustering based on storage usage
* clustering-strg-cpu-ram.ipynb for clustering based on storage, CPU, and RAM usage
* clustering_cpu_ram.ipynb for clustering based on CPU and RAM usage
* pricing.ipynb for analyzing the pricing of resources
* resources.ipynb for calculating and predicting resource usage
